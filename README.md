## Overview

Des Moines requested data for a business proposal. August 2019 Citibike data from NYC was reviewed by looking at geographical data as well as data disaggregated by user types and genders to determine if it would be a good investment for Des Moines. Other data points include usage durations, peak usage times, and the key target market.

## Tableau Story

### Cleaning the Data:

Jupyter Notebook was used to change the trip duration data to a datetime field.

### Results of the NYC Citibikes Analysis:

For NYC, some trips were outside the main city center. Other areas followed the along the river. Future analysis would need to include a geographical review.

### 1. Checkout Times for All Users
### 2. Checkout Times by Gender
### 3. Trips (Weekday per Hour)
### 4. Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
### 5. Trips by Gender and User Type (Weekday per Hour)
### 6. Number of Rides per Hour
### 7. Number of Rides with Bike ID

### Summary:

    Bike Repairs for 1/3 of the Citibikes need to be done during non-peak hours around 1-5 am. Male subscribers are the highest users and follow the traditional high use times of travel to and from work. Target market should be males needing transportation to work and weekend activities and push for subscribing to the services.
